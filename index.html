                    <p>Hello, my name is Hector Diaz Jr. I'm currently taking a web developing course in an attempt
                    learn a new skill. It has been quite challenging so far, but I'm hoping to successfully complete it. 
                    I have been at my current employer just over 14 years. My current position is in continuous improvement.
                    I'm hoping that this programs will allow me to continue working in my field with a new set 
                    of skill set that can advance our future projects.
                    </p>
                   <br>
                   <p>
                    A little more personal information about me. I'm happily married. My wife and i have been married for
                    over 20 years. We have two wonderful kids that have entered the teenage years. Brand new challenges 
                    for my wife and I. However, we wouldn't trade this experience for anything in the world. We enjoy 
                    traveling as a family, and have many places we would love to visit. I have a attached a few images 
                    on my portfolio of places we like to visit. One day, when this pandemic is over, we hope to continue
                    traveling. We would love to plan a trip at the completion of this course. It is proving to be a great 
                    sacrifice, not only for me, but for my family.

# Bootstrap
02 Homework
Homework for this week consisted in creating 3 separate html files 
Index.html with information about ourselves
Portfolio.html with 5 images
contact.html with a contact card
each of the pages needed to responsive to different screen sizes

Resources used were bootstrap and w3 schools

The majority of the components used in each page were directly taken from bootstrap and modified to fit my need. 

I struggled with this assignment in that I believe the border of the main elements could have fit better around the content.

The links were to work properly, which shoud be working

The contact card doesn't respond like I wouod like. I could not figure out how to enlarge the message text box, which is something I would have liked to do.

Proper semantic language was to be followed

see below for images of each html page
